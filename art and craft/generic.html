									<p>It is undeniable, people who can successfully create arts and crafts are special. Sometimes people would even refer to them as modern day alchemists depending on the type of arts and crafts that they complete. In a sense, they can transform base materials into something beautiful, eye-catching, and delightful. While in some cases people may over-dramatise the artists by saying they can turn items into gold, it’s still no debate about the transformative power that these artists have.</p>
									<p>For centuries, the only thing potters have done with their craft is to take a lumpy piece of clay before creating something extremely beautiful with it by mixing it with water and other tools. Other than creating something that’s eye-catching, these creations made by pooters can be used to fulfil and aid in everyday functions such as drinking, eating, or holding an arrangement of flowers.</p>
									<p>On another side, painters are taking an array of pigments such as red, blue, and yellow before putting them to paper, pots, walls, and canvases to create something unique. The amazing thing about these artists is that they have the power to create anything from folk art to fine art. Many of the materials that these artists use, potters, painters, and sculptors, can be found locally and naturally and usually are not overly expensive in some cases. This can help the artist in the long run with crafting more without breaking their bank.</p>

										<h2>Art is About Patience</h2>

									</header>
									<p>It’s the art of patience and practice that are helping these artists succeed. By using their imagination and pushing themselves to the limits – the artist can open their mind and own creativity to make something beautiful. Whether they are using their hands and feet or other tools, they are still creating art. That’s one the pure beatifies of this that anyone can create arts and crafts if they push themselves. No matter if it is as structured as a famed painter or something just created with clay, it’s still art.</p>
									<P>Many artists themselves have stated it’s the art that shapes the person – not visa versa. This is due to the self-revelation that people get where they are creating art, once they get it in their mind that they have the ability to create something beautiful and unique to them and are basically unstoppable in the art world.</P>
									<P>Through the usage of the words, artist and artisans should not intimidate nor limit you. I believe that those words should be used as an umbrella term to describe what the person is doing – crafting and creating something. Though, in some cases, those terms can be used as a simple distinction between those who are skilled in their crafts. In a sense though, arts and crafts are like twins: they simple below to one another and coexists with ease. Which is just to say that artists such as Henry Moore were no less than a craftsperson than artists like Lucie Rie, and visa versa.</P>
									<P>Many artists will tell you – art is not just a hobby, it becomes a livelihood, no matter how much you do it., No matter if you are creating simple DIY’S, extravagant works with clay and paints, or even just drawing on paper, at some point the art will become a part of you and express who you are. Being an artist is more than getting recognition for it, it’s having a way to express yourself in a unique and beautiful way.</P>
