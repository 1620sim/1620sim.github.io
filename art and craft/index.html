Shade the outer triangles as we will not be using them. Cut along these diagonals and the middle square. Now your template is ready. Trace this template on a colorfully patterned sheet. You can even trace it and cut it on a plain colored sheet and stick a patterned square piece in place of the square shape on the edge. Now fold the top triangular pieces inwards. To form a closed lap. Use a glue stick to seal all the edges. This will form a pocket for the page of the book.

											<h3>Glowing Paper Planet</h3>
											<p>This glowing paper planet craft is really easy to make. This is a perfect room decoration for an aspiring astronaut. You can even make these crafty planets for school science projects or to teach the students about the different planets and our solar system. First of all cut out circle from a bright colored sheet. Fold these circles in half. So that you get a semi-circle. Now make a slit in the middle of this semi-circle. This will become the slit to fit in the base of the spherical planet. Once you have made the slits in all the circles, fit them all in a white hard stock sheet circular base. Once all the slit circles have been fit in, you get the basic frame work of the planet. Now cut a larger light colored ring to adorn the planet framework. Stick it all around the planet framework. Tie a thread on the ring of the planet. This will help you hang the planet craft. You can use different colored sheets and other decorative material to differentiate between different planets of the solar system.</p>
